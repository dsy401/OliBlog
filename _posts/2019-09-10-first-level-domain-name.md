What is a first-level domain name? Many people are unclear about the second-level domain name, the first-level domain name and the top-level domain name. Today we will specifically explain what the second-level domain name, the first-level domain name and the top-level domain name are, and what is the difference between the three.

In fact, the first-level domain name is the top-level domain name. This is just two names of the same domain name. Many friends think that zzidc.com is a top-level domain name, and www.zzidc.com is a first-level domain name. In fact, this is a wrong understanding. Zzidc.com is a top-level domain and a first-level domain. When registering a first-level domain name, it is required to pay, while the second-level domain name and the third-level domain name are extended based on the first-level domain name, and the second-level domain name and the third-level domain name are free. In the case of domain name server support (generally supported), modify the DNS server address of the domain name to be the space provider, and then add the domain name in the space control panel. The subsequent resolution record and the second-level domain name need to be operated by the space provider. Of course, the second-level domain name and the third-level domain name are free, but most servers limit the number of second-level domain names. This can cause pan-parsing, and the specific form of the second-level domain name is mainly prefixed with www. Domain names like www.zzidc.com, and second-level domains like prefixes such as host.zzidc.com. Www.zzidc.com and host.zzidc.com are both second-level domain names. The two are equal, but people are accustomed to using the second-level domain name prefixed by www as the main domain name of the website, which is more convenient for everyone to remember.
