Today, i'm gonna review a simple data structure Stack. The Characteristics of Stack is LAST IN FIRST OUT. 

In this data structure, the data is piled up like a building block, and the data added later is placed on the top layer. When used, the first layer of data is used first, which is called "last in, first out."
