Today, i'm gonna review a simple data structure Stack. The Characteristics of Stack is LAST IN FIRST OUT.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;![](/assets/img/Stack_graph.png){: width="385" height="260"}

In this data structure, the data is piled up like a building block, and the data added later is placed on the top layer. When used, the first layer of data is used first, which is called "last in, first out."

In conjunction with this structure, there are some specific methods, mainly the following:

1. push: Add data at the top level
2. pop: return and remove the topmost data
3. peek: return the topmost data, but do not remove it
4. is\_empty: return bool, which indicates whether the current stack is an empty stack.

For example, see the python code below:

~~~python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def is_empty(self):
        return self.items == []

    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        try:
            result = self.items.pop()
        except IndexError:
            result = "The stack is empty!"
        return result

    def peek(self):
        try:
            result = self.items[0]
        except IndexError:
            result = "The stack is empty!"
        return result

    def to_string(self):
        return self.items
~~~

When will we use Stack?

1. The judgment of the balance symbol is called at the current level. Like&nbsp; &nbsp;((()))))), determine it whether closed or not.

2. &nbsp;

   Infix expression to postfix expression
